# Reverse_Transform_Fourier_Function
This Python script, when given noise should return the relevant function associated with that noise, although as of now it can't really do that for any noise given to the script but it does work for noise generated in the form of functions as such.
The script uses matrices and the matrix inversion method to compute the constants that are present in the fourier approximate.
Theoritically, when the script is given noise, it should return the correct value of the constants that we get when we compute the integrals in the fourier function manually, in practice, observing such a result would be out of the scope of this script.
